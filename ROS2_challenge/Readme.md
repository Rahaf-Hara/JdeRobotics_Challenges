# ROS2 Challenge Overview

This repository contains solutions to a two-part ROS2 challenge focused on fundamental ROS2 concepts and advanced navigation with the Navigation2 stack. The challenge is divided into two parts:

## Part 1: Introduction to ROS2

The first part of the challenge involves creating a simple ROS2 publisher-subscriber system. The publisher node publishes the message "Hello! ROS2 is fun", and the subscriber node listens to this message and prints it.

## Part 2: ROS2 Navigation2

The second part of the challenge explores advanced ROS2 functionalities with the Navigation2 stack. It involves performing waypoint navigation with a TurtleBot robot in a simulated Gazebo environment. The robot navigates through at least three waypoints.

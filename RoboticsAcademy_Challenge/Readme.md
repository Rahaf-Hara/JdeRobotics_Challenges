# Robotics Academy Challenge

## Overview
This challenge involved installing Robotics-Academy on my machine and solving an exercise, focusing on web-based templates. Robotics Academy offers a practical way to learn robotics, providing exercises on various topics like drone programming, computer vision, and mobile robots.

## Exercise Solved
- **Follow Line Exercise:** The objective was to program a robot to autonomously follow a line within a simulated environment. A crucial part of the challenge also involved fine-tuning the PID (Proportional, Integral, Derivative) parameters to ensure stable and accurate line-following behavior. 

## Results
You can find my solution code in the `Solution` folder. For a demonstration of the exercise in action, check out this
